## Parse the input

The first thing I did was to come up with some input schemes. One could go with a bracket
notation like `((((5 6) (7 4 5)) ((3))) (((6) (6 9)) ((7))) (((5)) ((9 8) (6))))`, but
that's barely readable so I choose one which contains two lines:

```
branches: 3 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 3 1 1 2 1 1 2 1
values:   5 6 7 4 5 3 6 6 9 7 5 9 8 6
```

The first line contains  the number of black lines on each level:

```
3
2 2 2
2 1 2 1 1 2
3 1 1 2 1 1 2 1
```

The second line contains the leaves' value, which must be on the same level for this to works.
This is ok, as long as it is easy to translate from a tree to this input scheme.

```ts
export interface Node<T> {
  value: T | null;
  children: Node<T>[];
}

export function parse<T>(sizes: number[], values: T[]): Node<T> {
  const queue: Queue<Node<T>> = newQueue();
  const root: Node<T> = { value: null, children: [] };
  queue.enqueue(root);

  // traverse first line input left-to-right
  for (const size of sizes) {
    const node: Node<T> = queue.dequeue()!;
    node.children = new Array(size);

    // create childrens and push them into queue
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const child: Node<T> = {
        value: null,
        children: [],
      };
      node.children[i] = child;
      queue.enqueue(child);
    }
  }

  // those remaining in queue are the leaves (i.e no size, no children)
  for (const value of values) {
    let node = queue.dequeue()!;
    node.value = value;
  }

  return root;
}
```

There is no queue in standard JS, so I went ahead and implemented one. I could have gone
simple with `Array.shift()` but I was curious if there is a simple but still efficient
one, and I went with the two stacks version:

```ts
export interface Queue<T> {
  dequeue(): T | undefined;
  enqueue(e: T): void;
  size(): number;
}

export function newQueue<T>(): Queue<T> {
  return new TwoStackQueue<T>();
}

class TwoStackQueue<T> implements Queue<T> {
  inbox: T[];
  outbox: T[];
  constructor() {
    this.inbox = [];
    this.outbox = [];
  }
  enqueue(e: T): void {
    this.inbox.push(e);
  }
  dequeue(): T | undefined {
    if (!this.outbox.length) {
      let item: T | undefined;
      while ((item = this.inbox.pop())) {
        this.outbox.push(item);
      }
    }
    return this.outbox.pop();
  }
  size(): number {
    return this.inbox.length + this.outbox.length;
  }
}
```

(DSA in action, yay)

One thing to note is these lines:

```ts
let item: T | undefined;
while ((item = this.inbox.pop())) {
  this.outbox.push(item);
}
```

While you can go with something like:

```ts
while (this.inbox.size()) {
  const item = this.inbox.pop();
  this.outbox.push(item); // item could be undefined
}
```

TypeScript will probably complain that item could be `undefined` and can't push into outbox,
as it doesn't understand the connection between `size()` and `pop()` with the current
implementation. You will have to add a non-null assertion like `this.inbox.pop()!` for
this to typecheck though. The version I used above check for `undefined` in the loop condition,
so it typechecks.

It's probably working properly. I hope.
